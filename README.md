/* Developed a GUI-based Student Management System using Java Swing that enables users to efficiently add, update, delete, import, and export student records. Integrated Apache POI to facilitate reading from and writing to Excel files, allowing seamless data import/export. Implemented input validation for fields such as ID, age, and year of joining, ensuring data integrity and user-friendly error handling. The application features a dropdown for department selection and displays student information in a dynamic JTable, offering a clean and intuitive interface. This project demonstrates practical application of object-oriented programming principles and real-world integration of file handling in Java. */
